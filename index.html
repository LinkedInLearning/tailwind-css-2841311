        On the edge of the world stands the progressive town of Binaryville, where technology is a way of life. The robots who live, work, and play in
        Binaryville learn from an early age that magic is made simply by combining 0's and 1's. For the Binaryville robots, every waking thought and
        every sleeping dream is consumed with unique permutations…and endless possibilities.
